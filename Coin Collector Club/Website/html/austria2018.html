        <h2>Description: </h2>
        <p>
            The theme of the 2018 special Austrian 2 Euro coin is 100 Years Republic of Austria.
            The end of the First World War was also the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
            On November 12, 1918, the Republic of Austria was founded.
            By the way, Hungarian and Slovenian are, in addition to German, official languages in Austria to this day!
            To commemorate that it was exactly 100 years ago that Austria was founded, a special 2 Euro coin has been issued.
            On the coin the Greek-style parliament building in Vienna is depicted.
            Greece was traditionally the cradle of democracy, hence this building style.
            Furthermore, the statue of Pallas Athena is portrayed.
            She is the goddess of wisdom and she is the symbol of the Austrian parliamentary system.
            On the left is the year 2018 below which is the text "100 Jahre" (100 years).
            At the bottom of the coin, in a semi-circle, is the country name REPUBLIK Ã–STERREICH (Republic of Austria).
